# Revit Reporting Web Pages

This app takes Revit model data formated in JSON files produced by Dynamo scripts and presents the data in an easy to digest visual format.

At it stands the app is very basic. This is very much a learning excerises project that I intend to keep going over the foreseeable future.

## To do
The app will be changed so that it can take multiple reports from a single project over time and compare\contrast the results.
The scope of the app will expand to accommodate an entire project and all disciplines\role Revit model reports.

Regular expressions are required to check the naming convensions of materials, Families, Types and other entities.
